Intro
-----
VeriCoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPCoin and VeriCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake and scrypt
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.
